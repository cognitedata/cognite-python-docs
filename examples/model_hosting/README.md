Model Hosting Examples
======================

## Prerequisites
In order to start using these examples, you need to be using Python 3.5.0

## Examples

### [Deploying and scheduling a simple function](simple_function/SimpleFunction.ipynb)

This example shows a source package for applying a trivial transformation to two time series and setting up a schedule 
run this transformation on incoming data every minute. This example is a good place to get comfortable with how the 
hosting environment works.

### [Deploying and scheduling a pretrained model](scheduled_model/ScheduledPrediction.ipynb)

This example is a slightly more complex version of the simple function example. We will still be scheduling a 
transformation on some time series data, but we will do so using a model we train locally and upload to the hosting 
environment.

### [Training and deploying a model in the hosting environment](simple_train_predict/TrainAndPredict.ipynb)

This example shows the how you can both train and deploy a model in the hosting environment.

### [Using Data Specs and the Data Fetcher](data_fetcher/)

This is a collection of a few examples showing how to use the data specs and the data fetcher found in the 
cognite-model-hosting library.
